                    <p>During my fifth semester I visited the optional
                        module “Keying”, where we worked with a Greenscreen.
                        There my group, consisting of Markus Fuhlbrügge, 						Frieda Koble, Nick Hartmann, Darwin Hakkenbrock
                        and me, created a short Trailer for a fictive movie 					called “Lost Humanity” as our finishing	assignment 					for the module.</p>

                        imprisoned in incubators by the evil one (Louphous) to transform them and make them his willing tools. Mësh lands on the planet, discovers the
                        transformation to evil and, together with Ronny, brings the longed-for salvation.</p>

                    <p>The creative process started with us wanting to 						make a science-fiction film. After some meetings and
                        some help from our professor we settled on the
                        setting as described in the logline. Here I
                        suggested the name “Lost Humanity” since the evil 					guy lost his humanity, he tries to strip people of 					their humanity to use them and when Mësh and Ronny 					fail Humanity is lost. Therfore “Lost Humanity” was 					fitting in more than one way. During the
                        preproduction phase I was in charge of the
                        typography for the movie. Here I settled on a basic 					design with the font “Neuzon Regular” illuminated by 					a blue light in the centre with varying
                        softness on the letters.
                        During the filming process I was the regisseur and 					helped with the sound.
                        In the end I edited all scenes with typography,
                        specifically scene 3, 6, 9 and 16</p>

                                During this project a great many things were new 					for me. I never held the role of regisseur
                                before. So, speaking with everyone and trying to 						convey my plan and vision for the current scene was 					challenging. The designing of a Typography was also 					challenging, since I am more of a coder and a
                                concept creator than a designer. Also, the whole
                                concept of Keying was completely new and
                                interesting, hence why I chose the subject in the 					first place. But I think I did my parts well and I 					am very happy with the result.
                                Also, I think this project was the one that put the 					most outside of my comfort zone, hence why I think I 					grew the most from this project as a person.
