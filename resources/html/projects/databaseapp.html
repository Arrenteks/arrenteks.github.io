                    <p>The concept behind the IP can be described as “Ori 
                        and The Blind Forest meets Hollow Knight in the 
                        Cold”, meaning the game is defined as strongly
                        story-driven and visually stunning. The gameplay and 
                        combat shall be easy to pick up, but also have a 
                        high enough difficulty to not be boring.</p>

                    <p>Fallen Light is my attempt at creating my own IP 
                        for a game. This was an assignment for the
                        module “Mediengestaltung 3”. It was created during 
                        my 5th semester and describes a world
                        ravaged by ice and cold due to the stopping of the 
                        planet’s rotation. After an apocalyptic
                        event only known as the ‚Eclipse‘ the player wakes 
                        up as the angel Azazel, who has no memories
                        of what came before. It is now the player’s task to 
                        find out what happened, who did it and
                        why everyone calls him the ‚Firebringer‘.

                    <p>I was the creative force behind Fallen Light. The 
                        general idea for this IP is mine. I created the
                        story, characters and defined the general visual 
                        aspect of the IP. I also did some competition
                        analysis and provided a general positioning for the 
                        game. Per the instructions and descriptions laid out 
                        by me in the design document and in conversation,
                        Dennis Voigt and Jessica Musch drew and colored two 
                        of the main characters: The player and a
                        traveling merchant.</p>

                               This Project was the first time I could put my years of "for ever Game Mastering" Experience to use. With some guidance from my professor and help
                               of some artist friends, this world really seemed to come together. And there is a silent hope, that one day I could see this game come to fruition.
