                    <p>This project was the final assignment for the module "Ausgew√§hlte Themen der Webprogrammierung" in college. It outlines a Golang programm, that constructs static .html 
                        files via information outlined in markdown files.

                    <p>The Go Portfolio was a project, which uses Golang as a base for getting data from a MongoDB Database, unpacking that data and constructing html Pages to display
                        some of my work. It was done during 5th semester of college and therefore has some unique code like the uploading of a ZIP to a database only to download and unpack
                        it again. This was done to meet the criterias outlined by our professer, in which we were supposed to launch everything in one go via a Docker File.
                        The upload to the database uses GridFS. This was not part of the assignment, I learned it by myself since I found it useful for the assingment.<br>
                        This was also the assignment, where I used Docker and WSL Linux for Windows for the first time.

                              This project was the first time I used Go on a larger scale. It brought me a bit outside of my comfort zone of Object-oriented Programming and taught
                              me something about how to approch a problem. Overall I am pretty happy how it turned out, especially how smooth the planning and implementation went.
                              I would do such a project again, because the language is pretty fun to use once your head wraps around how to solve problems without classes.
