                    <p>For the exchange project I was a gameplay programmer. It was my job to rewrite the movement script into a more familiar form for everyone. I also was 
                        in charge of the logic and the behavior of the enemies and the final boss. I also wrote the grappling hook item, with which the player can swing 
                        through the levels. Aside from that I helped with worldbuilding and leveldesign</p>

                        <h3>General Approach</h3>
                        <p>The enemies use a basic FOV Coroutine combined with a state machine to first detect the player then follow him until he is killed or the player vanishes from
                            their sight successfully.

                            <p>The Grappling Hook is a Gameplay Element, that allows the player to quickly traverse a certain distance by shooting a rope to that point.
                               Programmwise I achived this by freezing the player for the jump, then shooting a Raycast to the target. If it was in Range I did a simple physics calculation
                               to get the force needed to reach the point. Then I applied the force. During the end of production another programmer reworked my script to work with the
                               input system choosen for the game. Unfortunately this person forgot to comment the code and the old script was overwritten instead of deprecated.
                               Therefore I could only comment where I knew what was happening. You could call this script a joint venture.

                                The exchange project was unfortunately a pretty rough time. We had to fight with 3 different time zones almost close to 14 hours apart from another. The language barrier was pretty high, which made 
                                working difficult. Some time later people especially from the UNAM started leaving the project. That way we were whittled down from in the 
                                beginning close to 30 people to about 10 to 13. Therefore we needed to adjust the scope accordingly and unfortunately frequently. 
                                The obstacles did not stop there unfortunately, the overall working environment in the german team soured pretty quickly due to a multitude of reasons which ultimately boil down to a lack of communication.
                                I would improve here by being more open about my thoughts and talk more about how others currently feel.<br>
                                I contributed towards the Gameplay Aspect of the Project. I was in charge of the enemy AI, I rewrote the movement script for the player and wrote a functional Grappling Hook. Also some of my scripts were the Basis for things like
                                the Health or On-Screen Enemy Health Bars.<br>
                                In the project I made the logic behind 3 different enemies: A sawdrone, a flying drone and the final boss.<br>
                                The basic structure is the same for all: A simple state machine with: Attack, Chase and Idle. In Idle they patrol between a set of Waypoints, in Chase they investigate the player and in
                                attack they try to kill the player in their own unique way. The sawdrone tries to drive the player to death, the flydrone shoots at the player and the boss tries both with a 
                                giant sawarm and a cannon in his eye.<br>
                                 I am pretty happy with the first two considering it was my first time writing enemies for a 3d environment. The Boss however, is not my best work. Unfortunately I only had 4 weeks to 
                                code him and that is not enough to work out all the kinks and focus on other assignments as well. Apart from that I am very happy about my contributions to the project.<br>
                                Would I do such a project again? Yes, this is one of these „once in a lifetime“ things
                                and I am a bit sad about how it turned out in the end. While the game turned into something I am proud in being a part of, I can not say the same thing about the team's working atmosphere.
                                If I were to do it again I would try to obtain a management position and try to work around some problems such as the language barrier and low morale towards the shared goal of a great game.<br> 
                                In conclusion, it was an interesting project with a very big load of issues, however I would jump at such an opportunity again. Since I know what lacked here, I have a good idea on how to improve these things from here
                                onwards. I also still have contact with my japanese colleagues, who now help me learn Japanese. So it was overall an okay experience, just very tense and very exhausting.
