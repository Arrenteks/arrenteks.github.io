                    <p>The Wind’s Will is a hardcore arcade game developed 
                        by me, Nando Berg, Elizabeth Seemann
                        and Jessica Hermann for the Global Game Jam 2023.
                        The theme for this Jam was “Roots”, therefore we 
                        conceptualized the idea that the user should
                        accompany a dandelion seed on its way to sprout new 
                        roots.</p>

                    <p>I coded some enemies and the parallax effect for 
                        the game. The enemies I did were: the bird,
                        the frog and a falling dandelion seed.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Bird</h2>
                        <p>The Bird is a simple enemy which flies 
                            from right to left and kills the player on
                             impact
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="/resources/img/bird.png" alt="bird">
                            <figcaption>The Bird</figcaption>
                        </figure>                     
            
                        <h2>Frog</h2>
                        <p>The Frog at first seems like the bird, 
                            only on the ground. But it is way more
                            dangerous. When the player flies through a hit
                            box in front of the frog, the frog will
                            jump and try to catch the player midair.
                        </p>
                        <figure>

                            <figcaption>The Frog</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h2>Falling Seed</h2>
                        <p>The seeds are an enemy, which 
                            was coded but not implemented. It was
                            supposed to be a hazard from up above. It would 
                            fall downwards in a sinus curve to
                            emulate the wind hitting the seed and the
                            player would have to avoid it.</p>
                            
                        <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
                        <p>As with every old-school arcade game we used the 
                            parallax effect to simulate depth, but as a
                            deliberate design choice instead of being limited by 
                            our resources. I was in charge of Coding the effect, 
                            while Elizabeth Seeman would draw the background
                            layers. The Effect works by displaying the same 
                            three pieces of background three times in a row. The 
                            camera would then move to the right while the pieces 
                            would follow with different velocities to simulate 
                            the depth of moving.
                            When a certain point is reached the first background 
                            would be set to the end of the last background to 
                            simulate a permanent background.</p>

                                During this project I learned how simple things can 
                                come together to create a compelling and fun game. I 
                                never coded a parallax effect before and thinking 
                                about different enemy types and how to implement 
                                them was very fun. Of course, I had fun working with 
                                my group, since we already were an established team 
                                and knew our strengths and weaknesses from
                                different previous projects. I would describe this 
                                project as very fun and successful.
