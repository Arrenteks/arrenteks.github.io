                    <p>The Long Journey is a prototype developed by me, 
                        Nando Berg and Elizabeth Seemann for the module 
                        “Spielekonzeption” – Game Conception. During this 
                        module we made small 2 weeks long Game Jams with
                        themes set by our professor. The theme for this game 
                        was “And if they are not dead – your game starts 
                        where other games end”. The basic concept for this
                        game was a simple 2D Action Platformer, where you 
                        follow a lone hero on his way home.</p>

                        will you meet a gruesome but heroic death?

                               This project was the first time I ever worked with Unity and C#. I made Games in theory before, but never coded for one. Therefore this was 
                               a special occasion and is the project that made me realise I wanted to focus my efforts on Game Development and Design. You could call this
                               project my "Origin Story".
